**Codex: Authoritarian Systemic Control**

### 1. Institutional Domination

- Capture all branches of government: executive, legislative, judiciary[1][7].
- Subordinate independent institutions (e.g., law enforcement, central banking) to regime interests[3][7].
- Maintain indefinite tenure for leaders or ruling parties, often in a one-party state[1].

### 2. Social Control Mechanisms

- Apply laws unequally to limit expressive freedom and enforce social conformity[6].
- Structure punishments and rewards to compel adherence to state-preferred norms[6].
- Target dissenters and vulnerable groups with harsher penalties; reward loyalists (‚Äúlackeys‚Äù) to create economic and social stratification[6].
- Use surveillance and informant networks to monitor and deter opposition.

### 3. Information and Disinformation

- Control and manipulate media, both state and private, to shape public perception[7].
- Propagate disinformation and amplify falsehoods to confuse and divide opposition[3].
- Suppress independent journalism and silence dissenting voices[3][7].
- Employ propaganda domestically and internationally to legitimize the regime[7].

### 4. Suppression of Civil Society

- Restrict or co-opt civil society organizations; allow only non-political activity[7].
- Infiltrate or dissolve organizations that challenge state authority.
- Use legal and extralegal means to intimidate activists and opposition leaders.

### 5. Manipulation of Elections

- Maintain the facade of elections but manipulate rules, suppress votes, and bias results[3][7].
- Use state resources to disadvantage opponents.
- Discredit or overturn unfavorable outcomes.

### 6. Power-Sharing and Elite Management

- Resolve conflicts among ruling elites through patronage, coercion, or violence[5].
- Prevent elite defections by distributing resources and privileges selectively[5].
- Use purges or promotions to maintain loyalty and eliminate threats.

### 7. Use of Violence and Coercion

- Employ security forces to quash protests and intimidate the public[1][3].
- Allow or encourage political violence to stoke fear and maintain order[3].
- Use targeted repression to diminish social trust and reduce organized opposition[6].

### 8. Economic Control and Cronyism
