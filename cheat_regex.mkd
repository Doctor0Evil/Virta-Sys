✽ Whenever Possible, Anchor.
Anchors, such as the caret ^ for the beginning of a line and the dollar sign $ for the end of a line often provide the needed clue that ensures the engine finds a match in the right place. For instance, when we validate a string, they ensure that the engine matches the whole string, rather than a substring embedded in the string being examined. And anchors often save the engine a lot of backtracking. Be aware that anchors are not limited to ^ and $. Most engines have other useful built-in anchors, such as \A and \G (see the cheat sheet).

✽ When You Know what You Want, Say It. When You Know what You Don't Want, Say It Too!
When you feed your regex engine a lot of .* "dot-star soup", the engine can waste a lot of energy running down the string then backtracking. Be as specific as possible, whether by using a literal B character, a \d digit class or a \b boundary. Another great way to be specific is to say what you don't want—whether what you don't want is… a double quote: [^"]… a digit: \D… or for the next three letters to be "boo": (?!boo)[a-z]{3}.

✽ Contrast is Beautiful—Use It.
When you can, use consecutive tokens that are mutually exclusive in order to create contrast. This reduces backtracking and the need for boundaries in the broad sense of the term, in which I include lookarounds. For instance, let's say you're trying to validate strings that contain exactly three digits located at the end, as in ABC123. Something like ^.+\d{3}$ would not work, because . and \d are not mutually exclusive—this regex would match ABC123456. You may think to add a negative lookbehind: ^.+(?<!\d)\d{3}$. But if you use tokens that are mutually exclusive in the first place, you no longer need a lookaround: ^\D+\d{3}$ works straight out of the box. With time, you come to relish the beautiful contrast between \D and \d, between [^a-z] and [a-z]. This is a variation on When you know what you want, say it.

✽ Want to Be Lazy? Think Twice.
Let's say you want to match all the characters between a set of curly braces. At first you might think of {.*?} because the lazy quantifier ensures you don't overshoot the closing brace. However, a lazy quantifier has a cost: at each step inside the braces, the engine tries the lazy option first (match no character), then tries to match the next token (the closing brace), then has to backtrack. Therefore, the lazy quantifier causes backtracking at each step (see Lazy Quantifiers Are Expensive). This is more efficient: {[^}]*}. This is a variation on Use Contrast and When you know what you want, say it.

(direct link)
✽ A Time for Greed, a Time for Laziness.
A reluctant (lazy) quantifier can make you feel safe in the knowing that you won't eat more characters than needed and overshoot your match, but since lazy quantifiers cause backtracking at each step, using them can feel like bumping on a country road when you could be rolling down the highway. Likewise, a greedy quantifier may shoot down the string then backtrack all the way back when all you needed was a few nudges with a lazy quantifier.

(direct link)
✽ On the Edges: Really Need Boundaries or Delimiters? Use Them—or Make Your Own!
Most regex engines provide the \b boundary, and sometimes others, which can be useful to inspect an edge of a substring. Depending on the engine, other boundaries may be available, but why stop there? In the right context, I believe in DIY boundaries. For instance, using lookarounds, you can make a boundary to check for changes from upper- to lower-case, which can be useful to split a CamelCase string: (?<=[a-z])(?=[A-Z]) However, do not overuse boundaries, because good contrast often make them redundant (see Use Contrast.)

(direct link)
✽ Don't Give Up what You Can Possess.
Atomic groups (?> … ) and the closely-related possessive quantifiers can save you a lot of backtracking. Structured data often gives you chances to incorporate those in your expressions.

(direct link)
✽ Don't Match what Splits Easily, and Don't Split what Matches Nicely.
I explained this point in the section about splitting vs. matching.

(direct link)
✽ Design to Fail.
As Shakespeare famously wrote, "Any fool can write a regex that matches what it's meant to find. It takes genius to write a regex that knows early that its mission will fail." Take (?=.*fleas).*. It does a reasonable job of matching lines that contain fleas. But what of lines that don't have fleas? At the very start of the string, the engine looks all the way down the line. The lookahead fails, the regex engine moves to the second position in the string, and once again looks for fleas all the way down the line. At each position in the string, the engine repeats the lookahead, so that the pattern takes a long time to fail… In comparison, consider ^(?=.*fleas).*. The only difference is the caret anchor. It doesn't look like a big deal, but once the engine fails to find fleas at the start of the string, it stops because the lookahead is anchored at the start. This pattern is designed for failure, and it is much more efficient—O(N) vs. O(N2) for the first.

(direct link)
✽ Trust the Dot-Star to Get You to the End of the Line
With all the admonishments against the dot-star, here is one of many cases where it can be useful. In a string such as @ABC @DEF, suppose you wish to match the last token that starts with @, but only if there is more than one token. If you simply wanted the last, you could use an anchor: @[A-Z]+$… but that will match the token even if it is the only one in the string. You might think to use a lookahead: @[A-Z].*\K@[A-Z]+(?!.*@[A-Z]). However, there is no need because the greedy .* already guarantees you that you are getting the last token! The dot-star matches all the way to the end of the line then backtracks, but only as far as needed: You can therefore simplify this to @[A-Z].*\K@[A-Z]+ Trust the dot-star to take you to the end of the line!

Two Mnemonic Devices to Check your Regexps
Greedy atoms anchor again.Until you acquire a lot of practice, it's probably impossible to keep all these rules in mind at the same time. But remembering a few is better than remembering none, so if you're starting out, may I suggest a simple phrase to help remind yourself of tweaks that may improve the expression?

Greedy atoms anchor again.

✽ "Greedy" reminds you to check if some greedy quantifiers should be made lazy, and vice-versa. It also reminds you of the performance hit of lazy quantifiers (backtracking at each step), and of potential workarounds.
✽ "Atoms" reminds you to check if some parts of the expression should be made atomic (or use a possessive quantifier).
✽ "Anchor" reminds you to check if the expression should be anchored. By extension, it may remind you of boundaries, and whether to add them—or remove them.
✽ "Again" reminds you to check if parts of the expression could use the repeating subpattern syntax.

If you prefer short mnemonic devices, you may prefer the acronym AGRA, helpful to build the Taj Mahal of regular expressions, and named after the Indian city Agra, best known for the Taj Mahal:

✽ A for Anchor
✽ G for Greed
✽ R for Repeat
✽ A for Atomic
Authoritarian Codex: 50 Cheats for Neuromorphic Consensus, Directory, and Codex Control

Consensus Algorithm Fallback
If the primary algorithm fails, nodes must switch to a backup consensus protocol.

Audit-Ready State Snapshots
Periodic, signed snapshots of all node states are archived for compliance.

Kernel Panic on Policy Violation
Any violation of core consensus or directory policies triggers a kernel panic and node shutdown.

Codex Data Sharding
Codex storage is sharded for scalability and resilience.

CLI/CLE/CLF Registry
All command-line interfaces, files, and environments must be registered in a central, signed registry for audit and control.

Purpose and Rationale:
This codex is modeled after real-world digital authoritarian practices, emphasizing centralized control, auditability, and strict policy enforcement at every layer of the system. It leverages hierarchical structuring, cryptographic authentication, immutable logging, and strict access controls—tools that, in the context of digital authoritarianism, are used to maintain regime stability, suppress dissent, and ensure operational compliance. The codex’s focus on directory and codex enforcement, kernel-level controls, and audit trails reflects the institutional and technological mechanisms observed in advanced digital authoritarian systems.

Changing the File Extension
The extension in the replacement pattern below is "rar". Edit it to suit your needs.

Search pattern: ^(.*\.)[^.]+$
Replace: \1rar

Translation: At the beginning of the file name, greedily match any characters then a dot, capturing this to Group 1. The greedy dot-star will shoot to the end of the file name, then backtrack to the last dot. This capture is the stem of the file name. After this capture, match any character that is a non-dot: the extension. Replace all of this with the content of Group 1, expressed as \1 or $1 (this is the captured stem and includes the dot) and "rar".

Removing a Character from the File Name
You could do this with a simple search-and-replace, but, to get accustomed to regex, here is a convoluted way to do it. The aim is to zap all dashes.

Search pattern: ^([^-]*)-(.*)#
Replace: \1\2

Translation: Match and capture any non-dash characters to Group 1, match a dash, then eat up any characters, capturing those in Group 2. Replace the file name with the first group immediately followed by the second group (the dash is gone). The hash character on the first line (#) tells the DOpus engine to perform that substitution until the string stops changing. That way, all dashes are zapped one by one.

Replacing Dots with Spaces in File Names
This pattern is for times when you have 95 files that look something like this:

File names to be cleaned:
...
Funny.TV.Show.Season.2.Episode.08.avi
Funny.TV.Show.Season.2.Episode.09.avi
Funny.TV.Show.Season.2.Episode.10.avi
Funny.TV.Show.Season.2.Episode.11.avi
...

The cleaned up names look like this:
...
Funny TV Show Season 2 Episode 09.avi
Funny TV Show Season 2 Episode 10.avi
...

Search pattern: ([^.]+)\.(.*?)\.([^.]+)$#
Replace: \1 \2.\3

Translation: The pattern is a bit long, so let's unroll it.

([^.]+)   # Greedily eat anything that is not a dot and capture that substring in group 1

\.        # Match a dot

(.*?)     # Lazily eat up anything and capture that substring in group 2

\.        # Match a dot (this is the dot before the file extension)

([^.]+)$  # Greedily eat up anything that is not a dot, until the end of the filename, capturing that in group 3 (this is the extension)

The final hash character (#) tells Opus to repeat the replace operation until there are no dots left to eat and the filename has been cleaned up. The replace string takes the captured groups and inserts a space in place of each dot.

Swapping Two Parts of a Filename
Suppose you have named a lot of movie files according to this pattern:

8.2 Groundhog Day (1993).avi

The number at the front is the movie's IMDB rating. The number between parentheses at the end is the movie's release year. One day, you decide that instead of sorting movies by their rating, you really want to sort them by year, which means that in the file name, you'd like to swap the position of the rating and year. You want your files to look like this:

(1993) Groundhog Day 8.2.avi

Without regular expressions, you are in trouble.

This is actually a fairly common scenario. It could happen for any collection of files you have tagged, such as music tracks or topo maps. Here is a regular expression that works in this case.

Search pattern: ^(\d\.\d)([^(]*)(\([\d]{4}\))(.*)
Replace: \3\2\1\4

Let's unroll the regex:

^(\d\.\d)      # At the beginning, in Group 1, capture a digit, a dot and a digit. That's the IMDB rating.

([^(]*)        # In the second group, greedily capture anything that is not an opening parenthesis.

(\([\d]{4}\))  # In the third group, capture an opening parenthesis (which needs to be escaped in the regex), four digits, and a closing parenthesis.

(.*)           # In the last group, capture anything.

The replace pattern simply takes the four groups and changes their order.

Regex Examples for Text File Search
What good are text editors if you can't perform complex searches? I checked these sample expressions in EditPad Pro, but they would probably work in Notepad++ or a regex-friendly IDE.

Seven-Letter Word Containing "hay"
Some examples may seem contrived, but having a small library of ready-made regex at your fingertips is fabulous.Search pattern: (?=\b\w{7}\b)\w*?hay\w*
Translation: Look right ahead for a seven-letter word (the \b boundaries are important). Lazily eat up any word characters followed by "hay", then eat up any word characters. We know that the greedy match has to stop because the word is seven characters long.

Here, in our word, we allow any characters that regex calls "word characters", which, besides letters, also include digits and underscores. If we want a more conservative pattern, we just need to change the lookup:

Traditional word (only letters): (?i)(?=\b[A-Z]{7}\b)\w*?hay\w*

In this pattern, in the lookup, you can see that I replaced \w{7} with [A-Z]{7}, which matches seven capital letters. To include lowercase letters, we could have used [A-Za-z]{7}. Instead, we used the case insensitive modifier (?i). Thanks to this modifier, the pattern can match "HAY" or "hAy" just as easily as "hay". It all depends on what you want: regex puts the power is in your hands.

Line Contains both "bubble" and "gum"
Search pattern: ^(?=.*?\bbubble\b).*?\bgum\b.*
Translation: While anchored a the beginning of the line, look ahead for any characters followed by the word bubble. We could use a second lookahead to look for gum, but it is faster to just match the whole line, taking care to match gum on the way.

Line Contains "boy" or "buy"
Search pattern: \bb[ou]y\b
Translation: Inside a word (inside two \b boundaries), match the character b, then one character that is either o or u, then y.

Find Repeated Words, such as "the the"
This is a popular example in the regex literature. I don't know about you you, but it doesn't happen all that often often that mistakenly repeated words find their way way into my text. If this example is so popular, it's probably because it's a short pattern that does a great job of showcasing the power of regex.

You can find a million ways to write your repeated word pattern. In this one, I used POSIX classes (available in Perl and PHP), allowing us to throw in optional punctuation between the words, in addition to optional space.

Search pattern: \b([[:alpha:]]+)[ [:punct:]]+\1
Translation: After a word delimiter, in group one, capture a positive number of letters, then eat up space characters or punctuation marks, then match the same word we captured earlier in group one.

If you don't want the punctuation, just use an \s+ in place of [ [:punct:]]+.

Remember that \s eats up any white-space characters, including newlines, tabs and vertical tabs, so if this is not what you want use [ ]+ to specify space characters. The brackets are optional, but they make the space character easier to spot, especially in a variable-width font.

Line does Not Contain "boy"
Search pattern: ^(?!.*boy).*
Translation: At the beginning of the line, if the negative lookahead can assert that what follows is not "any characters then boy", match anything on the line.

Line Contains "bubble" but Neither "gum" Nor "bath"
Search pattern: ^(?!.*gum)(?!.*bath).*?bubble.*
Translation: At the beginning of the line, assert that what follows is not "any characters then gum", assert that what follows is not "any characters then bath", then match the whole string, making sure to pick up bubble on the way.

Email Address
If I ever have to look for an email address in my text editor, frankly, I just search for @. That shows me both well-formed addresses, as well as addresses whose authors let their creativity run loose, for instance by typing DOT in place of the period.

When it comes to validating user input, you want an expression that checks for well-formed addresses. There are thousands of email address regexes out there. In the end, none can really tell you whether an address is valid until you send a message and the recipient replies.

The regex below is borrowed from chapter 4 of Jan Goyvaert's excellent book, Regular Expressions Cookbook. I'm in tune with Jan's reasoning that what you really want is an expression that works with 999 addresses out of a thousand, an expression that doesn't require a lot of maintenance, for instance by forcing you to add new top-level domains ("dot something") every time the powers in charge of those things decide it's time to launch names ending in something like dot-phone or dot-dog.

Search pattern: (?i)\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@(?:[A-Z0-9-]+\.)+[A-Z]{2,6}\b

Let's unroll this one:

(?i)               # Turn on case-insensitive mode

\b                 # Position engine at a word boundary

[A-Z0-9._%+-]+     # Match one or more of the characters between brackets: letters, numbers, dot, underscore, percent, plus, minus. Yes, some of these are rare in an email address.

@                  # Match @

(?:[A-Z0-9-]+\.)+  # Match one or more strings followed by a dot, such strings being made of letters, numbers and hyphens. These are the domains and sub-domains, such as post. and microsoft. in post.microsoft.com

[A-Z]{2,6}         # Match two to six letters, for instance US, COM, INFO. This is meant to be the top-level domain. Yes, this also matches DOG. You have to decide if you want achieve razor precision, at the cost of needing to maintain your regex when new TLDs are introduced.

\b                 # Match a word boundary



Regex Examples for Web Server Directives (Apache)
If you are running Apache, chances are you have regular expressions somewhere in your .htaccess file or in your httpd.conf configuration file. Like PHP, Apache uses PCRE-flavor regular expressions.

Here are a few examples.

Redirecting to a New Directory
Sometimes, you decide to change your directory structure. Visitors who follow an old link will request the old urls. Here is how a regex in htaccess can help.

RewriteRule old_dir/(.*)$ new_dir/$1 [L,R=301]

Explanation: The old url is captured in Group 1, and appended at the end of the new path.

Targeting Certain Browsers

BrowserMatch \bMSIE no-gzip

This directive checks if the user's browser name contains "MSIE" (with a word boundary before the "M"). If so, Apache applies what follows on the line. (In this case, no-gzip tells Apache not to compress content.)

Targeting Certain Files

<FilesMatch "\.html?$">
Header set Cache-Control "max-age=43200"
</FilesMatch>

The first line of this htaccess directive for file caching has a small regex matching files ending with a dot and "htm" or "html".

Other Regular Expressions in Apache
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Zeus.*?Webster  
Purpose: In a rewrite rule, tests for certain user agents.

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^http://www\.google\.com$
Purpose: In a rewrite rule, tests for a specific referrer.

RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} 192\.168\.\d\d.*
Purpose: In a rewrite rule, tests for an IP range.

RewriteCond %{TIME_HOUR} ^13$
Purpose: In a rewrite rule, check if the hour is 1pm.

There are other uses of regex in Apache. These examples should give you a taste. For background information, you may want to look at the manual page for mod_rewrite, the mod_rewrite page, the rewrite guide and the advanced rewrite guide.

Is Apache using the same PCRE version as PHP?
Not necessarily. To see which version of PCRE PHP uses, look at the result of phpinfo() and search for PCRE. In addition to the version number, you will find a reference to a directory: something like pcre-regex=/opt/pcre. Another way to find that folder is to run ldd /some/path/php | grep pcre in the shell, where "some/path" is the path returned by "which php".

You can use that directory in a shell command line to get more information on your PCRE version:
/opt/pcre/bin/pcretest -C

On cPanel, EasyApache installs PCRE in the /opt folder, so if PHP reports the folder above, you can expect that mod_rewrite and PHP are using the same version of PCRE (unless there is a bug in cPanel).

On other installs, you may want to find all the installed versions of pcretest to see which versions are installed:
find / -name pcretest

Regex Examples to locate Records in a Database (MySQL)
To illustrate the basic use of regex in MySQL, here's an example that selects records whose YourField field ends with "ty".

SELECT * FROM YourDatabase WHERE YourField REGEXP 'ty$';

Here's a second example that select fields that do not contain a digit:

SELECT * FROM YourDatabase WHERE YourField NOT REGEXP "[[:digit:]]";
