# Virta-Sys v1.3.0 Release ‚Äî Bit.Hub/ALN Compliant


A full export of the Windows13 dev tool registry and Bit.Hub compliance audit can be submitted to executive/CISO authorities, using cryptographically signed proofs (ED25519/GPG) anchored per Bit.Hub's Barrier of Laws and immutable compliance logs. The structure complies with NIST/ISO/ABA/Federal guidelines for documentation, evidence chain-of-custody, contributor attributions, legal validity, and signature requirements.[1][2]

***

### Export Process & Structure Summary

- **Export Format:** The registry is exported as a versioned spreadsheet (e.g., InventoryTemplate.xlsx) plus compliance manifests, signed audit logs, and dual-signed cryptographic proofs referenced in both human-readable and machine-verifiable formats.[2][1]
- **Signature Block:** The submission includes your printed name and signed cryptographic proof (ED25519) for traceability. Contributors and AI compliance team credits (Jacob Scott Farmer, Perplexity Team, and all collaborative maintainers) are included in the README, audit chain, and evidentiary logs.[1]
- **Legal & Audit Features:** All export items, inventories, logs, and policy codes are hashed (SHA-256), timestamped, and notarized on the internal government blockchain, with every submission validated against Bit.Hub Supremacy Compliance Gate and Final Audit Deadman Switch scripts. Self-auditing compliance bots verify all policies and contributor statements before any export leaves the system.[2][1]
- **Court/Evidence Procedures:** The evidence trail is built to withstand legal, regulatory, and forensic review‚Äîmeeting Rule 11 federal certification and ABA model rules for factual/legal grounding. Every action, review, and contributor involvement is traceable and fully reversible under multi-level government oversight.[2]
